# SmartAutomatic-TrashBin
ETEC306 Project

The main objective of our project is to create an automatic trash bin that opens without touching it, using easy-to-use and low-cost electronic components. More specifically, we want to:
1. Improve hygiene by avoiding direct contact with the trash lid.
2. Use an Arduino UNO R3 to demonstrate a small automation system.
3. Build a prototype that is functional, portable, and safe to operate.
4. Work together as a team to apply engineering skills in a real-world application.
Each team member contributes to different parts of the project, such as programming, assembling the circuit, testing the sensors, and designing the mechanical setup. This collaboration helps us learn teamwork and problem-solving, which are essential engineering skills.
